## Use a recent version!
Arduino IDE 1.00 was released 30 November 2011

Check out latest available Arduino IDE from: http://code.google.com/p/arduino/downloads/list

If your Arduino IDE version is <= Arduino-0023:

The ArduinoISP that ships as an example with the Arduino software is old.
You can download the ArduinoISP.ino here and replace the one you find
in ...\arduino-002x\examples\ArduinoISP.
This version is known to work with the avrdude that ships with Arduino-0023.
That is an older version of avrdude (5.04, latest is 5.11).
